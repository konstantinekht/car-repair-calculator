            <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
            <p>
                Every year, millions of car owners face expensive repair decisions without 
                good information. Should you spend $3,000 to fix your transmission, or is 
                it time to buy a different car?
            </p>
            <p>
                Most advice comes down to simple rules like "don't spend more than 50% of 
                your car's value." But these rules ignore your specific situation: your 
                budget, your timeline, your car's maintenance history, and your local costs.
            </p>
            
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                Our calculator uses real data to compare the total cost of repairing vs. 
                replacing over your planning timeline. We factor in:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your car's current market value</li>
                <li>Estimated future maintenance costs based on age and mileage</li>
                <li>Average insurance costs in your state</li>
                <li>Depreciation over time</li>
                <li>Loan costs if you finance a replacement</li>
                <li>Trade-in value if you sell your current car</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Our Data Sources</h2>
            <p>
                We compile data from multiple trusted sources:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kelley Blue Book for vehicle values</li>
                <li>RepairPal and YourMechanic for repair cost estimates</li>
                <li>National insurance databases for state-by-state averages</li>
                <li>Industry-standard depreciation rates by make and model</li>
            </ul>
