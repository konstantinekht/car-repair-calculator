                <p class="intro">
                    Deciding when to replace your car is one of the most stressful financial 
                    decisions you'll face. Repair bills are piling up, but a new car payment 
                    feels overwhelming. Here are 7 clear warning signs it's time to stop 
                    repairing and start shopping.

                <h2>1. The 50% Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    The most widely used rule in the auto industry: if a repair costs more 
                    than 50% of your car's current market value, it's time to replace it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if your car is worth $8,000 and you're facing a $4,500 
                    transmission repair, that's 56% of its value. The math doesn't work 
                    in your favor - you'd be putting nearly half the car's value into 
                    a repair that doesn't increase its worth.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Repair Costs Are Exceeding Your Monthly Budget Repeatedly</h2>
                <p>
                    One big repair is manageable. But if you've spent more than $2,000 
                    on repairs in the past 12 months AND another major repair is needed, 
                    you're likely in a cycle that won't end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Track your repair spending over 2 years. If you're averaging more 
                    than $150-200/month in repairs, a car payment might actually be 
                    cheaper.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Your Mileage Is Over 150,000</h2>
                <p>
                    Modern cars can absolutely exceed 200,000 miles - but they require 
                    increasingly expensive maintenance to get there. Once you cross 
                    150,000 miles, you're entering the territory where:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Timing belts and chains need replacement ($500-$1,500)</li>
                    <li>Transmission issues become more common</li>
                    <li>Suspension components wear out faster</li>
                    <li>Electrical gremlins become harder to diagnose</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    High mileage alone isn't a reason to replace - but combined with 
                    other factors on this list, it tips the scale toward replacement.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Safety Systems Are Failing</h2>
                <p>
                    Some repairs aren't about convenience - they're about safety. 
                    If any of these are failing and repairs are expensive, replacement 
                    is strongly recommended:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Brake system (rotors, calipers, master cylinder)</li>
                    <li>Steering components</li>
                    <li>Airbag system (recall or malfunction)</li>
                    <li>Structural rust affecting frame integrity</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. The Car Fails Emissions and Can't Be Fixed Cheaply</h2>
                <p>
                    In states with emissions testing (California, New York, Georgia, 
                    and 30+ others), a car that can't pass inspection can't be legally 
                    driven. If the repair to pass emissions costs more than $800-1,000, 
                    replacement often makes more financial sense.
                </p>

                <h2>6. You Can No Longer Get Parts</h2>
                <p>
                    For cars older than 15-20 years, finding parts becomes increasingly 
                    difficult and expensive. When mechanics start saying "I had to source 
                    that from a junkyard" or "that part has a 6-week wait," your repair 
                    costs and downtime will only increase.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Your Lifestyle Has Changed</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the decision isn't purely financial. If any of these apply, 
                    replacement may be worth the cost even if the math is close:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>New baby or growing family needs more space</li>
                    <li>New job requires more reliable transportation</li>
                    <li>Long commute makes fuel efficiency critical</li>
                    <li>Medical condition requires specific vehicle features</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When You Should Keep Repairing</h2>
                <p>
                    Replacement isn't always the right answer. Keep repairing if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repair cost is less than 25% of car's value</li>
                    <li>Car has under 100,000 miles</li>
                    <li>You have a good mechanic you trust</li>
                    <li>You can't afford a down payment right now</li>
                    <li>Your credit score would mean a very high interest rate</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>
                    No single rule applies to every situation. The right decision depends 
                    on your car's specific condition, your local repair costs, your 
                    financial situation, and your plans for the vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best approach is to run the actual numbers for your specific 
                    situation - which is exactly what our calculator does.
